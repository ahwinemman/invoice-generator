# invoice-generator
This project is built with the Spring Java Framework.
To run, you pull the project and run InvoiceGeneratorApplication
At this point, your Tomcat Server should have started on port 8080.
There is an index.html file in the root directory that you can use to test the endpoint by feeding it your own excel file once the server is up.
